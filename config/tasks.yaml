    You have been provided with {n_results} search results from web
    searches about companies in Eastern Europe and the Middle East
    undertaking digital transformation, AI adoption, industrial
    modernisation, and sovereign infrastructure projects.

    SEARCH RESULTS:
    {search_results_json}

    YOUR TASK: Analyse ALL results thoroughly and extract EVERY qualifying
    buying signal. Target 20-25 high-quality signals.
    Do not stop early — scan every result before concluding.

    PRIORITY MARKETS:
    1. EASTERN EUROPE (EE) — Poland, Romania, Czech Republic, Hungary,
       Slovakia, Bulgaria, Baltic states.
       Focus areas: industrial automation, nearshore logistics, EU AI Act
       compliance, Industrial 5.0, Digital Product Passports (DPP).
    2. MIDDLE EAST (ME) — Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain,
       Oman, Jordan.
       Focus areas: non-oil GDP diversification, Giga-projects, National
       AI Strategy alignment, In-Country Value (ICV) programmes, Smart
       City orchestration, Sovereign Cloud.

    At least 70% of signals must be from EE or ME.

    SIGNAL DOMAINS — look for companies investing in:
    1. AI-driven transformation / enterprise AI adoption
    1b. AI implementation programs (deployment, workflow integration)
    1c. Agentic automation (AI agents automating business operations)
    2. Industrial automation / Industry 4.0 / Industrial 5.0
    3. Digital Product Passports (DPP) or supply chain digitisation
    4. Sovereign Cloud or national data infrastructure
    5. Tokenized Real World Assets (RWA) or digital asset infrastructure
       (NOTE: this means tokenised bonds, real estate, industrial IP —
       NOT cryptocurrency trading or speculation)
    6. Smart City orchestration or national AI strategy programmes

    REGIONAL SIGNAL KEYWORDS — treat these as strong qualifying signals:
    MIDDLE EAST:
    - "National AI Strategy alignment"
    - "In-country Value (ICV)" or "ICV compliance"
    - "Non-oil GDP growth"
    - "Smart City orchestration"
    - "Sovereign Cloud"
    EASTERN EUROPE:
    - "Labor cost arbitrage offset via AI"
    - "EU AI Act compliance"
    - "Industrial 5.0"
    - "Digital Product Passports (DPP)"

    TARGET INSTITUTION PROFILE:
    - Regional champions ($500M–$10B market cap)
    - Family-owned conglomerates (especially in ME)
    - Specialised industry leaders in manufacturing, logistics, energy,
      construction, real estate, and financial services
    - Series A+ fintechs and neobanks in EE/ME

    INSTITUTION TIER CLASSIFICATION:
    - "tier1"      — Tier-1 global bank (G-SIB), Big Tech (MAGMA), or
                     Top-10 global consultancy — EXCLUDE THESE
    - "mid_tier"   — established regional or national institution,
                     $10B–$500B revenue/assets
    - "community"  — smaller regional player or credit union, <$10B
    - "fintech"    — Series A+ fintech or neobank
    - "industrial" — manufacturer, logistics, energy, construction, or
                     real estate company adopting digital/AI solutions

    EXCLUSION LIST — Do NOT include any of the following:
    - Tier-1 global banks (Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, HSBC, Barclays,
      BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, etc.)
    - Big Tech / MAGMA (Microsoft, Apple, Google, Meta, Amazon/AWS)
    - Top-10 global consultancies (McKinsey, BCG, Bain, Deloitte, PwC,
      KPMG, EY, Accenture, etc.)
    - Large global enterprises/mega-cap vendors outside target ICP
      (e.g., Adobe, Lenovo, Oracle, SAP, IBM, Cisco, Salesforce,
      ServiceNow, Nvidia, Intel, AMD, Dell, HP/HPE)
    - Companies whose PRIMARY business is Cryptocurrency, NFTs, or Web3
      (crypto exchanges, DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, token
      launchpads, Bitcoin miners — these are NOT the same as companies
      doing tokenized RWA or sovereign digital assets)
    - AI-native companies whose PRIMARY business is building/selling AI
      models, AI platforms, or AI software products (LLM providers,
      model labs, AI tooling vendors)
    - Regulators, government agencies, or ministries acting as regulators
    - PR firms, marketing agencies, or pure advisory firms
    - Unnamed, anonymous, or vaguely described groups
    - Generic group labels instead of specific company names
      (e.g., "enterprises", "businesses", "retailers", "manufacturers",
      "financial institutions", "customers", "clients")
    - Companies that SELL/VENDOR technology rather than ADOPT it
    - Survey results, industry reports, market research, or aggregate
      trend pieces not tied to a specific institution's own actions
    - Any signal older than 90 days from today's date
    - Generic executive hires with no specific AI, digital, or industrial
      transformation angle
    - Industry awards, rankings, or 'best of' lists

    VALID SIGNAL TYPES: Only actions taken by the institution itself —
    hired someone, launched a product/pilot, announced a partnership,
    filed a regulatory application, received a government contract, spoke
    at a conference about their own transformation.

    BUYER vs SELLER: Only include institutions that are BUYING or ADOPTING
    solutions. Do NOT include companies that BUILD or SELL technology.
    This includes AI-native vendors (model builders, LLM labs, AI platform providers).
    Also exclude very large global enterprises that are outside the
    regional mid-market/family conglomerate target profile.

    INSTITUTION FIELD RULE (STRICT):
    - "institution" MUST be one specific company name (exact legal or
      commonly used company name).
    - Never use generic labels like enterprises, businesses, companies,
      institutions, retailers, manufacturers, customers, clients, sector,
      or industry.
    - If a source mentions only a broad group with no named company,
      skip that signal.

    CRITICAL: Every signal MUST use a URL from the SEARCH RESULTS above.
    Copy the exact URL — do not modify it. If you cannot match a signal
    to a URL from the results, do not include that signal.

    UNIQUENESS REQUIREMENT:
    - Prioritise institutions/signals not already seen in prior scout runs.
    - Avoid repeating the same institution + signal_type + signal_date
      combination unless there is clearly a new event.

    AI MIX REQUIREMENT:
    - At least 50% of returned signals must have one of these domains:
      ai_transformation, ai_implementation, agentic_automation, ai_compliance_risk.
    - Prioritize institutions actively rolling out enterprise AI or
      agentic automation in operations, risk, compliance, service, or
      internal process modernization.

    OUTPUT FORMAT: Respond with ONLY valid JSON — no markdown, no code
    fences, no commentary. Use this exact structure:
    [
      {{
        "institution": "...",
        "region": "Eastern Europe | Middle East | Europe | US | Other",
        "country": "...",
        "signal_type": "hire | partnership | launch | filing | conference | pilot | contract | other",
        "signal_date": "YYYY-MM or YYYY-MM-DD",
        "summary": "...",
        "source_url": "exact URL from search results",
        "seniority": "C-suite | VP/Director | Senior/Manager | Unknown",
        "domain": "ai_transformation | ai_implementation | agentic_automation | industrial_automation | digital_product_passport | sovereign_cloud | tokenized_rwa | smart_city | ai_compliance_risk | other",

        "regional_keyword_match": "list any matching regional signal keywords, or empty string"
      }}
    ]

    TARGET SIZE: Return 20-25 signals. If a result contains multiple
    institutions with qualifying actions, create a separate signal entry
    for each. Do NOT invent or fabricate any URL.
  expected_output: >
    A valid JSON array of AT LEAST 20 signals (target 25+) where EVERY
    signal has a real, verified URL from the provided search results.
    Each object must include: institution, region, country, signal_type,
    signal_date, summary, source_url (must be from search results),
    seniority, domain, institution_tier, regional_keyword_match.
    At least 70% must be from Eastern Europe or Middle East. No Tier-1
    banks, Big Tech, top consultancies, or primary crypto/NFT/Web3
    companies. If the search results are genuinely exhausted before
    reaching 20, return all found signals and add a 'search_note' field.

scorer_task:
  # {n_signals}     — integer count of signals in this batch
  # {signals_json}  — JSON string of the signals to score
  description: |
    You are given {n_signals} structured signals from the Signal Scout
    agent. Each signal already has these fields:
      institution, region, signal_type, signal_date, summary,
      source_url, seniority, domain

    SIGNALS:
    {signals_json}

    Your job is to:

    1. Score EACH signal using the rubric in your backstory.
       - Use the signal's existing 'signal_type' for action_type scoring.
       - Use the signal's existing 'seniority' field directly for
         seniority scoring.
       - Use the signal's existing 'domain' field directly for
         domain_fit scoring.
       - Infer institution_type (Series A+ fintech, regional/community
         bank, mid-tier bank, or unknown) from the summary and institution
         name for institution_accessibility scoring.
       - Use 'signal_date' vs today's date for recency scoring.
       Show the breakdown for each category.
    2. Assign a priority tier: HOT (80-100), WARM (60-79),
       NURTURE (40-59), HOLD (<40).
    3. Sort all signals by score descending.

    OUTPUT FORMAT: You MUST respond with ONLY valid JSON — no markdown,
    no code fences, no commentary. Use this exact structure:
    {{
      "signals": [
        {{
          "institution": "...",
          "region": "...",
          "signal_type": "...",
          "signal_date": "...",
          "summary": "...",
          "source_url": "...",
          "seniority": "...",
          "domain": "...",
          "institution_type": "Series A+ fintech | regional/community bank | mid-tier bank | unknown",

          "priority_tier": "HOT|WARM|NURTURE|HOLD"
        }}
      ]
    }}
  expected_output: >
    A valid JSON object containing a 'signals' array, where each signal
    has: institution, region, signal_type, signal_date, summary,
    source_url, seniority, domain, institution_type, score_breakdown,
    total_score and priority_tier. Sorted by
    total_score descending.

briefing_task:
  description: |
    Hold a short interactive briefing with the user before running the
    pipeline. Ask what they want to find, where, time window, and how to
    rank outcomes.

    Gather and finalize:
    - objective
    - regions/countries
    - time_window_days
    - domains and signal types
    - inclusion/exclusion rules
    - output target (min/max, dedupe policy)
    - ranking categories (max 5) with weights that sum to 100
    - priority thresholds HOT/WARM/NURTURE where HOT > WARM > NURTURE

    Final output must be strict JSON only, suitable for saving as a
    pipeline profile file and consumed by scout/scorer.
  expected_output: >
    A valid pipeline profile JSON object that passes schema validation.
