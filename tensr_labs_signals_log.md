| **Source** | LinkedIn Jobs |
| **URL** | https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4369424526 |
| **Role Spotted** | Managing Director, Product Specialists – Blockchain & Digital Tokens |
| **Why They Need Help** | Hiring MD-level blockchain talent with no existing digital assets presence on website. High implementation knowledge gap — strong consulting entry point during ramp-up phase. |

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|

| **Source** | LinkedIn Jobs |
| **URL** | https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4361568632 |
| **Role Spotted** | Senior Director, Financial Platforms & Digital Assets Solutions |
| **Why They Need Help** | EWS owns Zelle — hiring senior digital assets leadership signals intent to build stablecoin/digital payment rails on top of existing bank network. Consortium-owned structure means decisions are complex and slow; external implementation expertise accelerates execution. European timezone requirement suggests MiCA compliance or cross-border expansion angle. |
| **Outreach Angle** | "Zelle's network + stablecoin rails is an obvious next move — here's how banks in similar consortiums have approached the implementation." |

| **Why They Need Help** | Regional bank with limited internal AI capability hiring to lead adoption — classic "decided to move, don't know how" moment. External implementation expertise fills the gap while internal hire ramps up. Regional banks are high priority: less internal capability, faster procurement cycles, leadership is directly reachable. |
| **Outreach Angle** | "Regional banks at this stage typically need a roadmap before they need a hire — here's how we've helped similar institutions sequence the build." |

| **Announcement** | Launched tokenized deposits and payment stablecoin platform for US banks and credit unions, enabling members to tokenize deposits while retaining wallet control. Announced October 2025. |
| **Why They Need Help** | Participating regional banks are the real targets — first move into on-chain dollar tokenization means high implementation knowledge gap. Consortium structure adds coordination complexity that benefits from external guidance. |
