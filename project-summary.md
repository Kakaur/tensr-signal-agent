## Planned Capabilities

### Week 7+ — Job Search Agent (Parallel Workstream)
Uses the same multi-agent architecture to find relevant job postings, score them by fit against my background, and use OpenClaw to send outreach to hiring managers on LinkedIn and email. Built in parallel with the Tensr Labs system from Week 7 onwards.

### Week 9-10 — OpenClaw Integration for Automated Outreach
When signal_scout.py identifies a High intent signal, OpenClaw automatically sends a personalised outreach email or Slack message to the relevant contact. This completes the end-to-end pipeline: signal discovery → scoring → autonomous outreach.
